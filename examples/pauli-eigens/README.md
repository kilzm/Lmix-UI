# Example 2 - "pauli-eigens"

A simple program to calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the pauli matrices with the eigen C++ template library. The Makefile uses pkg-config for the cflags.

## Building with modules

Load the following modules:
* eigen
* pkgconfig
* intel-oneapi-compilers/2023.1.0

Then use `make`.

## Flake generation

The flake has been autogenerated using lmod2flake. With the aforementioned modules loaded type:

```
$ nix run . -- ./examples/pauli-eigens
```

## Building from the flake

Building the program in a nix development environment works like expected:

```
$ nix develop -i
$ make
``` 

## Building as a derivation

For a simple project like this writing a nix derivation is not hard. We use the same buildInputs as in the devShell. Since the Makefile does not specify `make install` we need to define the installPhase manually. Run:

```
$ nix build
```
